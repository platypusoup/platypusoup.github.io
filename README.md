# platypusoup.github.io

This started as a thing for a Codecademy course on how to deploy a website.

Now I'm using it to help me understand Github. There's just something about it that I can't wrap my idiot head around so I need to just start using it and get over the fact that it's a public thing where people could be looking at it.

I'll also start poking around and reading other READMEs because I'm certain that their purpose is not for weirdos to blog about their Github repos.
